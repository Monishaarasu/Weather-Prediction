Logistic Regression
Agenda
we will cover the following concepts with the help of a business use case:

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Data Cleaning
Logistic Regression with Sklearn
Use Case: Logistic Regression
Note: At first, with the help of a use case, we are going to perform all the basic steps to reach the training and predicition part.
